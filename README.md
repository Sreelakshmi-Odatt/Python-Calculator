## Description

This Python script is a simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It takes two numerical inputs and an operator from the user to perform the calculation.

## Usage

1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. Enter the first numerical value when prompted.
3. Enter a valid operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) when prompted.
4. Enter the second numerical value when prompted.
5. The script will calculate and display the result.

## Input Validation

- The script handles input validation for numerical values, ensuring that the user enters a valid number.
- The script also checks for a valid operator, allowing only `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`.

## Error Handling

- The script uses try-except blocks to handle potential errors, such as division by zero or invalid input.
- If the user provides invalid input or an unexpected error occurs, a generic error message is displayed.
